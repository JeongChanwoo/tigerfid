# API

This folder contains the latest APIs. They should allow you to develop software that will control every type of hardware (reader, field generators, tags).

## Contents

### C++ .Net (c-plus-plus-dot-net)

There are two subfolders - the `api-files` and an `example`.

### C# .Net (c-sharp-dot-net)

### VisualBasic .Net (vb-dot-net)

There are two subfolders - the `api-files` and an `example`.
