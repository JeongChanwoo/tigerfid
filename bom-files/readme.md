# BOM Files

This folder contains the most up-to-date Bill of Materials (BOM) files we could find. Each directory contains the BOM files we found associated with that particular device.

## Contents

### BOM Cost

These are the actual labor and parts costs associated with building each device.

### Compact Flash

These are the BOM files for the CF Reader. This device wasn't used towards the end of my father's life, so it may need some updating to work with the latest version of the other devices.

### Field Generator

These are the BOM files for each FGen, which operate as a repeater or extender (depending on how you configure your system).

### Handheld

These are the BOM files for the Handheld Reader devices. Much like the CF Reader, this may be best used with older versions of the tags and other readers.

### Misc

These are random BOM files we found in the root folder and are unsure as to whether they are the latest versions or not.

### Reader

These are the BOM files for the Readers. The medium-reader is most likely the best one to use as it was the most popular, but the standard-old-reader was used a bit as well.

### Tag

These are the BOMs for all the tags, including options.

### Transceiver

Unfortunately, we're not 100% sure what this is, but we know it is important. We believe it is something that must be built into the Readers, but again, we are unsure.
