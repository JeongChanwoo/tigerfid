## Introduction

This repository has been created in honor of my father, Touraj Ghaffari. He founded [ActiveWave, Inc.](http://www.activewaveinc.com/) in 2001. It was his life work and something he loved and enjoyed thoroughly. He also loved spreading knowledge. In honor of that principle, we, his three sons, have open-sourced everything associated with his active RFID system under the [Apache 2.0 license](license). We hope this release helps you acheive your dreams.

_Note: Any help in cleaning up the files or directory structure is very much appreciated. We included everything we found in case any of it is useful to someone. Any and all advice is appreciated!_
