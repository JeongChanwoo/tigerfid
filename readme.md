# TigeRFID

## Introduction

This repository has been created in honor of my father, Touraj Ghaffari. He founded [ActiveWave, Inc.](http://www.activewaveinc.com/) in 2001. It was his life work and something he loved and enjoyed thoroughly. He also loved spreading knowledge. In honor of that principle, we, his three sons, have open-sourced everything associated with his active RFID system under the Apache 2.0 license. We hope this release helps you acheive your dreams.
