# Software

These are the applications that were used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system.

### AWI Sounds

These are the sound files used with the Smart Tracker.

### Demo CD

This is the CD with the software that was included with Demo Kits. It includes software that was fully-functional, but limited to 15 tags (we believe).

### Programming Station

This is the software that needs to be used to actually program and re-program tags.

### Smart Tracker

This is the application that can actually be used to monitor tags, set zones, assign Field Generators to Readers, and more.
